#Programming With Futures 

_The goal of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with the infrastructure and the tools required during this class._

#####Part 1: Obtain the Project Files
To get started, download the reactive-async.zip handout archive file and extract it somewhere on your machine.

#####Part 2: Editing the Project
In case you like using an IDE, import the project into your IDE. If you are new to Scala and donâ€™t know which IDE to choose, we recommend to try IntelliJ. You can find information on how to import a Scala project into IntelliJ in the IntelliJ IDEA Tutorial page.

Then, in the folder src/main/scala, open the package async and double-click the file Async.scala. This files contains an object whose methods need to be implemented.

When working on an assignment, it is important that you don't change any existing method, class or object names or types. When doing so, our automated grading tools will not be able to recognize your code and you have a high risk of not obtaining any points for your solution.

#####Part 3: Running your Code
Once you start writing some code, you might want to experiment with Scala, execute small snippets of code, or also run some methods that you already implemented. We present two possibilities to run Scala code.

Note that these tools are recommended for exploring Scala, but should not be used for testing your code. The next section of this document will explain how to write tests in Scala.

Using the Scala REPL
In the sbt console, start the Scala REPL by typing console

#####Part 5: Testing your Code
Throughout the assignments of this course we will require you to write unit tests for the code that you write. Unit tests are the preferred way to test your code because unlike REPL commands, unit tests are saved and can be re-executed as often as required. This is a great way to make sure that nothing breaks when you have go back later to change some code that you wrote earlier on.

We will be using the ScalaTest testing framework to write our unit tests. Navigate to the folder src/test/scala and open the file AsyncSuite.scala in package async. This file contains a some tests for the methods that need to be implemented.

You can run the tests by invoking the test sbt command. A test report will be displayed, showing you which tests failed and which tests succeeded.
